## Challenge
Build something to help educate individual investors on ESG topics. This is open to interpretation, but a few ideas include providing easily digestible ESG data, establishing an individualâ€™s unique ESG values and/or helping investors navigate the world of ESG investments.

## Solution
Our solution is to build a [website](https://jealouswhales.herokuapp.com) explaining ESG percentiles. As well as display top corporations ESG evaluations based on data scrapped from the web.
